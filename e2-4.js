/*calculate the Average
Calculating an average is an extremely common task. Let's practice it a bit.

Algorithm

Find the sum as we did in the first exercise
Take the sum from step 1, and divide it by the number of elements in the list. */

let numbers = [6, 12, 1, 18, 13, 16, 2, 1, 8, 10]; 
let suma =0
for(let i=0; i<numbers.length; i++){
  numbers[i]
  suma=suma+numbers[i]

}
console.log(suma)
console.log(suma/numbers.length)
